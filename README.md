1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because the message part involves multiple componets to make it work. Unit tests are meant to test isolated features.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because the max length of the message can be isolated and tested, it doesn't reply on many componets unlike the "feature". We would just need to check if the character count excceeds 80.
